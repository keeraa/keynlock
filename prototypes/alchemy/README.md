# Alchemy prototypes — cleaned

Staging copy of the single-file demo, split up and made safe to embed. Nothing
here is wired into the game yet: `check.mjs` only walks `js/` and `css/`, so
this folder is invisible to the build.

## What changed

**Images out of the stylesheet.** Five PNGs were inlined as base64, which is
265 KB of the 416 KB file. They are files now (202 KB — base64 inflates by a
third), so the browser caches them instead of re-parsing them with every load
of the stylesheet.

**Split into parts.** 12 KB html, 70 KB css, 69 KB js.

**The script is wrapped in a closure.** It declared 231 top-level names. The
game loads classic scripts that all share one lexical environment, where two of
those (`apply`, `shuffle`) already collide — and that environment has bitten us
twice already (`noise` against the audio generator, `gate` against the motion
permission). Wrapped, it contributes nothing to the global scope. Expose
through `window.Alchemy` when wiring it in.

**The stylesheet is scoped under `.alchemyRoot`.** Eleven class names collide
with the game, and several are load-bearing there: `.tab` styles the 19 mode
tabs, `.locked` eight map nodes, `.scene` is the game's main stage, plus
`.app`, `.active`, `.status`. Dropped in raw, the prototype would restyle half
the game. `alchemy.scoped.css` is generated from `alchemy.css` by prefixing
every selector; keyframes are left alone. Verified both ways — the prototype
renders the same under the root class, and loading the scoped sheet into the
running game changes nothing.

Nothing was removed: checked for dead CSS and there is none. All 169 classes
are referenced, several only from template strings in the script.

## Where this stands (v290)

In the game: `js/world/alchemy.js`, `css/alchemy.css`, `assets/alchemy/`,
reached from a lair hotspot. Three stations run — mixing, concentrations,
separation. The whole prototype script came over at once, so the remaining
seven need only their markup; missing elements get a stand-in rather than
throwing, and every query the ported code makes is confined to `#alchemyRoot`.

Styles the seven cannot reach yet are parked in `stations-pending.css`. Move a
block back when its station's markup lands.

Stylesheet went 87 KB -> 44 KB: the demo's own page chrome, the rules bound to
unported stations, and the prototype's layout, which was written for a
scrolling catalogue and replaced with about 4 KB written for the lair window.
The glassware and the 81 lines of game logic were never touched — that is the
part worth keeping.

Success is only a verdict for now. Nothing is banked; potions that carry into
the next lock are the agreed next step, not built.

## Two things that cost hours — do not rediscover them

**The class names leak both ways.** Eleven are shared with the game. Scoping
this stylesheet under `.alchemyRoot` keeps alchemy out of the game, and that
much was done in v284 — but nothing kept the game out of alchemy. Its `.status`
is positioned absolutely, so the verdict drew over the reagent labels; its
`.scene` is `width:100vw !important` **and** `width:min(1180px,100vw)
!important`, which pinned the station at 1180px inside an 888px panel. Nothing
outranks `!important`: not `minmax(0,1fr)`, not `min-width:0` on every grid
item, not an inline width. The guard at the top of the layout section resets
these with `!important`. If a station ever measures wider than its panel again,
look there first.

**Percentages will not size this chain.** The module body's height comes from
growing as a flex item — a used height, not a specified one — so `height:100%`
below it resolves to auto. The chain is flex and grid throughout for that
reason.

## Still to do

The other seven stations — markup only, no JS work. A bench texture under the
glassware and recipe cards were proposed and not built; both need a decision
first.
