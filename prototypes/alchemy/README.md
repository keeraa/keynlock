# Alchemy prototypes — cleaned

Staging copy of the single-file demo, split up and made safe to embed. Nothing
here is wired into the game yet: `check.mjs` only walks `js/` and `css/`, so
this folder is invisible to the build.

## What changed

**Images out of the stylesheet.** Five PNGs were inlined as base64, which is
265 KB of the 416 KB file. They are files now (202 KB — base64 inflates by a
third), so the browser caches them instead of re-parsing them with every load
of the stylesheet.

**Split into parts.** 12 KB html, 70 KB css, 69 KB js.

**The script is wrapped in a closure.** It declared 231 top-level names. The
game loads classic scripts that all share one lexical environment, where two of
those (`apply`, `shuffle`) already collide — and that environment has bitten us
twice already (`noise` against the audio generator, `gate` against the motion
permission). Wrapped, it contributes nothing to the global scope. Expose
through `window.Alchemy` when wiring it in.

**The stylesheet is scoped under `.alchemyRoot`.** Eleven class names collide
with the game, and several are load-bearing there: `.tab` styles the 19 mode
tabs, `.locked` eight map nodes, `.scene` is the game's main stage, plus
`.app`, `.active`, `.status`. Dropped in raw, the prototype would restyle half
the game. `alchemy.scoped.css` is generated from `alchemy.css` by prefixing
every selector; keyframes are left alone. Verified both ways — the prototype
renders the same under the root class, and loading the scoped sheet into the
running game changes nothing.

Nothing was removed: checked for dead CSS and there is none. All 169 classes
are referenced, several only from template strings in the script.

## Ported (v285)

`js/world/alchemy.js`, `css/alchemy.css`, `assets/alchemy/`. Reached from a new
lair hotspot; three stations are wired up — mixing, concentrations, separation.

The whole script came over at once, so the remaining seven need only their
markup. Missing elements get a stand-in instead of throwing, and every query
the ported code makes is confined to `#alchemyRoot`.

## Still to do

**The other seven stations** — markup only, no JS work.

**A purpose.** Decided: potions that carry into the next lock — less noise per
move, sturdier picks, guards arriving later. Nothing is banked yet; finishing a
station only reports its verdict.
